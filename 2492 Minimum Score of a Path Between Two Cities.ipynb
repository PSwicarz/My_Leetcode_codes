    "### Intuition\n",
    "At the first glance when you hear weighted graph and shortest path you think about Dijkstra's algorithm and fancy stuff like this, but actually is way simpler. Here we have situation when we care only about shortest SECTION of the path:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example : If we had race from A->C which is only 2 apart, but path was connected with Y->Z which are 1 apart, we would had to go to Y->Z and then back to C, marking 1 as the shortest section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if all sections were connected (which they dont have to be), we could just go trough list of pahts and check for minimum distance right there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "So all we have to do is to go to trough all possible sections conneted to start/end, and remember which section was shortest. What's important and a bit missleading, it's that we don't have to go trough any point more than once, we must only immediatly check if path is shortest, and THEN drop it, if it leads to point we already visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python best for this approach is deque, as with normal BFS, BUT we could use simple list and pop from right, since we have to check all connected points anyway, and we don't care about how long it would take overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "Time complexity: at most O(N) since not all points have to be connected into single graph. We care only about those points which are connected with starting point (it's guaranteed that start and finish are connected)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: O(3N) -> O(N) since we have to store all possible paths in both ways in dictionary and we at worst all sections will be simultaniously in que."
