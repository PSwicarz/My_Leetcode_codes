# My_Leetcode_codes



## What it is all about?
LeetCode.com is a competitive programming site/forum/learning hub for those who want to improve their coding skills.

In this repository, I will be sharing solutions that I came up with during Leetcode programming competitions or during regular practice.



## Form of the repository
Each solution will be stored as a separate Jupyter file created in VSCode.

Each file will conatin:
  - a copy of the question from Leetcode.com
  - commented code solution written in Python

Some solutions will also have written intuition, explanation and complexity analysis ( Big O )
Files dont havet to be complete at the begining. Over time, they will improve both in scope and quality.


## -- important -- 
The code provided in the solution is appropriate to use on a specific question on LeetCode.com, but it cannot be used on its own.
