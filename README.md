# My_Leetcode_codes

## What it is all about?
Leetocde.com is competetive programming site/ forum / learning hub for all who want to increase their coding skills.

In this repository I will be sharing solutions that I came up with during Leetcode programming competitions or during regular practice.

## Form of the repository
Each solution will be stored as a separate jupyter file created in VSCode.

Each file will conatin:
  - a copy of the question from Leetcode.com
  - commented code solution writen in python

Some solutions will also have written intuition, explanation and complexity analysis ( Big O )
