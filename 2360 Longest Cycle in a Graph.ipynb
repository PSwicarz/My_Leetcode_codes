    "### Intuition\n",
    "We have to keep track of all points visited as well as points visited in current run. Additionally we have to keep track of order of currently visited points, to know when was the first time we saw it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "for all visited we simply create visited_all set outside the loop, to check if have we already been on that point - if we were, and since all points have only one way, we already checked path it leads to and we can break inner loop. The same if we have already been on this point in CURRNET run, this means its a loop. Thats why we need cur_visited list - index of this point in current_visited marks start of the loop, and we can use it (len(cur_visited) - cur_visited.index(point))\n",

    "### Complexity\n",
